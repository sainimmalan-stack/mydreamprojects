# My Dream Projects — PRD

## Original Problem Statement
Premium, production-quality responsive website for residential construction company **MY DREAM PROJECTS** (tagline: YOU DREAM. WE BUILD., founded 2020, Ameenpur, Hyderabad, founders Nimmala Sai & Kotapati Akhil, 19 projects: 13 completed / 6 ongoing). High-end architectural portfolio feel — NOT a generic Indian real-estate template. Palette: deep charcoal/near-black, warm off-white, concrete grey, warm beige, restrained orange accent. No stock apartment/construction imagery, no fake AI buildings, no excessive gradients/gold. Pages: Home, Projects, About, Contact + reusable project-detail template. Desktop nav: Logo | Home | Projects | About | Contact | LET'S TALK →. Full-screen mobile menu, iPhone-optimized. Focus: design system, navigation, page structure, reusable components. No invented project info, bios, testimonials, awards, or building images — real content/assets come in later steps.

## User Choices (confirmed)
- Single editable data file feeding Projects + detail pages
- Minimal abstract placeholders (concrete/architectural-shadow textures, duotone-treated) until real photos arrive
- Contact form is design-only for now
- Awwwards-level ambition: kinetic hero masked line reveal, editorial marquee, numbered manifesto chapters, framer-motion scroll reveals, lenis smooth scroll, hero parallax

## Architecture
- Frontend-only React SPA (no backend dependency yet)
- `src/data/projects.js` — single source of truth: 19 projects (13 completed, 6 ongoing), `getProject`, `getAdjacent`, `projectStats`
- `src/components/layout/Navbar.jsx` — sticky glass nav + full-screen animated mobile menu
- `src/components/layout/Footer.jsx` — sitemap, studio info, big tagline
- `src/components/Marquee.jsx` — slow editorial outline-text marquee (react-fast-marquee)
- `src/components/ProjectCard.jsx` — reusable card with duotone texture, index, status pill
- `src/pages/` — Home, Projects (filterable), About, Contact (design-only form), ProjectDetail (template with stats grid, placeholder gallery, prev/next)
- Motion: framer-motion (masked reveals, whileInView, hero parallax via useScroll/useTransform), lenis root smooth scroll
- Design tokens in tailwind.config.js: ink #0A0A0A, coal #121212, bone #F4F4F0, concrete #7A7A7A, beige #D9D4C7, ember #E85D22; fonts Outfit (display) + Manrope (body); film grain overlay + structural grid lines

## Implemented (2026-08-06)
- Full design system, routing, 4 pages + project detail template
- Kinetic hero with masked line-by-line reveal + parallax
- Editorial marquee, numbered manifesto chapters, stats band
- Projects index with All/Completed(13)/Ongoing(6) filters + animated grid
- Full-screen mobile menu, verified at iPhone 390px (no horizontal overflow)
- Design-only contact form with preview note

## Verified
- Desktop: home hero/manifesto/projects sections, projects filters (6 ongoing cards), detail page nav, contact page
- Mobile (390×844 emulation): hero, hamburger → full-screen menu → projects nav, no h-overflow

## Backlog
- P0: Real project names, locations, years, descriptions, photography (drop into `src/data/projects.js`)
- P0: Real logo file, founder photos/bios, phone/email on Contact
- P1: Wire contact form to backend/email delivery
- P1: Favicon/OG images, SEO meta per page
- P2: Project gallery lightbox, floor-plan viewer, site-progress updates per project

## Next Tasks
1. Receive real content/assets and populate projects data file
2. Replace logo wordmark with final logo asset
3. Backend enquiry endpoint + email notification
